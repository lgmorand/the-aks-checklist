      "detail": "While Kubenet is the default Kubernetes network plugin, the Container Networking Interface (CNI) is a vendor-neutral protocol that lets the container runtime make requests to a network provider. The Azure CNI assigns IP addresses to pods and nodes, and provides IP address management (IPAM) features as you connect to existing Azure virtual networks. Each node and pod resource receives an IP address in the Azure virtual network, and no additional routing is needed to communicate with other resources or services.",
