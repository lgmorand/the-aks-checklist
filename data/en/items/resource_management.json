Involuntary disruptions can be caused by hardware failure, network partitions, kernel panics, or a node being out of resources. Voluntary evictions can be caused by performing maintenance on the cluster, the Cluster Autoscaler deallocating nodes, or updating pod templates. To minimize the impact to your application, you can set a PodDisruptionBudget to ensure uptime of the application when pods need to be evicted. A PodDisruptionBudget allows you to set a policy on the minimum available and maximum unavailable pods during voluntary eviction events. An example of a voluntary eviction would be when draining a node to perform maintenance on the node.",
