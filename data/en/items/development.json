These access credentials could be defined with the container image or injected as a Kubernetes secret, but need to be manually created and assigned. Often, the credentials are reused across pods, and aren't regularly rotated. Managed identities for Azure resources (currently implemented as an associated AKS open source project) let you automatically request access to services through Azure AD. You don't manually define credentials for pods, instead they request an access token in real time, and can use it to access only their assigned services.",
