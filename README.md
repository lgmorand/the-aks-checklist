The AKS Checklist is a (tentatively) exhaustive list of all elements you need to think of when preparing a cluster for production. It is based on all common best practices agreed around Kubernetes or documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/best-practices).

Another good reading in another format is the [AKS baseline reference architecture](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-secure-baseline)

## How to contribute

Fork the repo, add the best practices in the items.json file (at least in English which will remain the single source of trust) and then do a pull request **on the staging branch** ;-)

Be aware that we want to keep a list as exhaustive as possible but also a list that met **common usage**. Depending on your context, you may have custom best practices that may apply only to your case.
