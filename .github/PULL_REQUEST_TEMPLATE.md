# READ CAREFULLY Thanks for contributing !! :)

## Branch staging

Do a merge on the **Staging branch**, NOT master. Github Actions does not allow to share secrets so during a PR, I can only do a build validation. I need an in-between branch to be able to deploy on a staging environment (https://stotheakscheckliststg.z6.web.core.windows.net/)
